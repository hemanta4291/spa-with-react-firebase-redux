## Introduction
This project is created based on an eCommerce shopping platform. Users can log in using their Google accounts and add items to the cart even without logging in. However, to proceed with the checkout, users need to log in. The login system is implemented using Firebase, and Redux Toolkit is used as the state container. That's all.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
